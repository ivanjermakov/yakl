    "## Efficiency definition\n",
    "\n",
    "Keyboard layout efficiency is a keyboard layout characteristic that measures comfortability and productivity (typing speed).\n",
    "However, it does not consider not directly related aspects like common layout habits or mechanical layout peculiarities.\n",
    "\n",
    "Efficiency is defined by the following aspects.\n",
    "\n",
    "| Aspect name                          | Weight |\n",
    "| :-                                   | -:     |\n",
    "| finger travel distance               | .4     |\n",
    "| consecutive keys on the same finger  | .3     |\n",
    "| consecutive keys on the same hand    | .1     |\n",
    "| dominant hand                        | .1     |\n",
    "| pinky usage                          | .1     |\n",
    "\n",
    "Each aspect has its weight, that is used to calculate efficiency.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Efficiency testing\n",
    "\n",
    "Efficiency test is represented by iterating over test text letter by letter.\n",
    "On each letter performed calculation of *penalty* - a sum of efficiency aspects, listed above.\n",
    "After iteration is complete, calculated average penalty of typed letters:\n",
    "\n",
    "\\begin{equation*}\n",
    "avg = \\frac{1}{n} \\sum_{n = 1}^{k} p_n\n",
    "\\end{equation*}\n",
    "\n",
    "Where $k$ - test text length, $p_n$ - typed letter penalty.\n",
    "\n",
    "\\begin{equation*}\n",
    "p = \\sum_a p_a * w_a\n",
    "\\end{equation*}\n",
    "\n",
    "Where $p_a$ - aspect penalty, $w^a$ - aspect weight.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Penalty\n",
    "\n",
    "Each aspect has its own way of calculating penalty.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Distance penalty\n",
    "\n",
    "Distance penalty is calculated by mapping the position of currently pressed key to the _distance map_.\n",
